## Issues
- Static variables for letters. If the program will be reset via button, the letters that will be displayed is not alphabetically. It will depend on the last sorted letters. You have to exit the program and run it again.
- Poor coding style/technique. I'm new to Java programming when I'm making this. Haha.
- The supported number of jobs will depend on the screen size of the computer. I created the user interface via dynamic textboxes.
